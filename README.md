# Culture ship names

In case you ever needed Iain M. Banks's Culture ship names as a service. Names sourced from the pleasingly extensive [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_spacecraft_in_the_Culture_series) listing them. Sadly a closed set.

## Usage

```javascript
var ships = require('culture-ships');

console.log(ships.random()); // one ship name
console.log(ships.ships); // all of the ships in alpha order
```

The module will also install a bin script called `culture-ships`.
